Camera-Arm
==========

This repository contains some of the final code used at the TOM (Tikkun Olam Makeathon) 2014 as part of the group "Mind control platform"

The directory "Android app" contains the android app used to control the camera (take the photo, zoom, and pan and tilt the servo motors). This app is based on the sample app provided by Sony.

"Arduino sketch" contains the sketch "simple" which received the commands from the Android app. The sketch should be installed on an Arduino ADK or equivalent.

For any questions about the software, please contact Jason Friedman (write.to.jason@gmail.com)
